              "1  The report presents the results from the evaluation of the two interventions undertaken, targeting the storage and marketing behavior of palm oil farmers in Sierra Leone. The first intervention, storage support, provided community storage rehabilitation, extra palm oil containers and marketing support to target communities. The second intervention, inventory credit, disbursed loans, while allowing farmers to use the oil stored in the community storage as collateral for the loans. The project aimed to allow farmers to better take advantage of variations in the sale prices of oil between the harvest and the off-seasons. The implementation of the interventions was coordinated by the Sierra Leone National Program Coordinating Unit (NPCU) at the Ministry of Agriculture and three Rural and Agricultural Banks (RABs). The report covers the first year of the intervention. The evaluation design was based on a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). A sample of 120 palm oil-producing villages located in the catchment areas of the three RABs was split into three groups. The first received the storage support intervention; the second received the inventory credit scheme; and the third was monitored as a control group. The evaluation draws from two main survey instruments (baseline and endline), logs of palm oil production and storage, and administrative data from the program. Analysis of baseline data shows that in the year previous to the intervention: (i) palm oil prices showed substantial increases from the harvest season to the offseason; (ii) farmers sell predominantly within a few months of harvesting and store only small amounts across seasons. The take-up rate was 29.9% for the storage support and 24.9% for the inventory credit. The programs did not have a significant impact on overall storage behavior or on the patterns of oil sales across seasons. The storage within the scheme primarily substituted for other forms of storage. Therefore, in the first year, the two schemes provided limited benefits for the participating communities. A simple profitability analysis reveals that, under the observed price dynamics, farmers could substantially increase revenues and profits from palm oil by raising their levels of storage. However, the evaluation documents low take-up of the programs. The report combines survey data and qualitative analysis to shed light on some potential reasons for low take-up. These include uncertainty over price realizations; low acquaintanceship and potentially low trust toward formal credit institutions; and high switching costs from existing trading relationships. The report concludes by highlighting lessons for implementing similar schemes in other countries or focusing on other crops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
              "2  Extension is designed to enable lab-to-farm technology diffusion. Decentralized models assume that information flows from researchers to extension workers, and from extension agents to contact farmers (CFs). CFs should then train other farmers in their communities. Such a modality may fail to address informational inefficiencies and accountability issues. We run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. We track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs. However, higher levels of CF adoption have limited impact on the behavior of other farmers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
              "3  Weather-based insurance products insure farmers against production risks on the basis of a weather index that is highly correlated to local yields. Indemnifications are triggered by prespecified patterns of the index, as opposed to actual yields. This eliminates the requirement of on-field assessments for indemnification, thereby lowering administrative costs and time. Therefore, index-based insurance products have been regarded as having enormous potential to reach small farmers in developing countries. Surprisingly, the demand and takeup rates are low for weather index insurance (WII) products. One of the reasons hypothesised for the low demand and take-up of index-based insurance products is their inherent complexity, which makes it difficult for farmers to perceive the direct benefits. Hence, to encourage stronger participation, the project introduced an innovative WII product that was simple, transparent, flexible and affordable for smallholder farmers. In fact, the insurance product was a menu of very simple insurance options, each with a flat payment, but different triggers and for different coverage periods. This product was tested in three districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, during two consecutive summer agricultural seasons (known as kharif in India) in 2011 and 2012 among the farmers who were cultivating rain fed soya bean crop. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of the product (simplified WII) on the production and consumption behaviours of smallholder farmers. In addition to this, the research also investigated the responsiveness of insurance demand to a set of randomly allocated interventions among farmers who were offered insurance products. These are: 1) Exogenous variation of the distance to the weather station by installing three new weather stations, which were randomly positioned. 2) Random assignment of price discounts for the insurance offered. 3) Provision of training to all farmers being offered the insurance product, but random variation of the intensity of training across villages. A comparison of differences in outcome variables among the baseline and a follow-up survey between control and treatment villages (through a difference in differences estimation) provided us with a test of the impact of offering WII to smallholder farmers. Empirically, we find evidence for the impact of our specific WII product, although results are not strong, arguably due to a lack of power that arose because of low take-up of the product. On the other hand, comparing take-up rates between different (randomly allocated) treatment arms allowed us to evaluate the responsiveness of insurance demand to our interventions, namely price discounts, weather station investments (a proxy to basis risk) and intensive training on insurance literacy. Overall, the demand for our simplified WII products was quite low, at 6.9 per cent and 4.03 per cent of the sample during kharif 2011 and 2012, respectively. We find that the demand falls as price and distance to the weather station increase. On the other hand, the demand for WII increases as product comprehension increases. Interestingly, the intensive insurance literacy training sessions conducted in the first year seem to be of a more transient nature, with no significant impact on understanding or demand during the second year. In terms of the dynamic effects of the programme, while purchasing insurance does not have a substantial impact on demand on its own in the subsequent year/season, purchasing insurance and receiving a payout is strongly positively correlated with the decision to purchase insurance in the subsequent season. However, observing other households in the village receiving a payout seems to have no impact on demand. This could also be explained by the low levels of trust in the product or the insurance company. This is an interesting avenue for future research. The study seems to support the hypothesis that the purchase of WII could have influenced the farmers to use hybrid seeds or high-yielding varieties to cultivate increased areas, to cultivate new crops, to adopt improved cultivation practices and to get additional loans. However, these results are not statistically strong. The insights gained from the study enable us to propose the following policy recommendations: 1) Thin networks of weather stations restrict the demand and scale-up of WII. 2) Provision of weather data by the weather service providers to the insurers has to happen without any time lag to enable quick indemnification. 3) Distribution and marketing channels are key to enhance take-up and scale-up of WII programmes. 4) An improved design of the WII product is key to minimise basis risk. 5) Affordability of WII insurance premiums is essential for a sustained take-up from smallholder farmers. 6) One-time WII literacy programmes have little, if any, long-lasting impact on insurance understanding and demand. This suggests that WII literacy programmes should be designed as part of a more permanent process over time so they can contribute to developing more sustainable micro-insurance markets (although more rigorous evidence of this recommendation will require longer-term research projects than this one).   \n",
              "4  We examine the sustainability of the impact of a biofortification program that introduced provitamin A-rich orange sweet potatoes (OSP) to farming households in Uganda. The crop was introduced in a randomized controlled experiment to test the impact and costeffectiveness of introducing OSP on crop adoption and dietary intakes of vitamin A. A previous impact evaluation of the two-year project using baseline and endline data found large impacts on both OSP adoption and vitamin A consumption in project households. Here, we study sustainability of the intervention by looking at the profile of OSP adoption during the project and over four seasons after the project's end. After achieving an adoption rate of 92 percent in the first season, a trajectory of declining adoption continued, and may have accelerated, after the project ended. Mean adoption rates fell to 37 percent four seasons after the project ended. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the adoption patterns across districts and between primary beneficiaries and neighboring farming households. This is consistent with a pattern of experimentation among initial adopters followed by a period of learning about profitability and consumption preference for the crop. Non-beneficiaries display a similar pattern of learning. We explore the mechanisms that predict decline and persistence in adoption behavior among various types of farmers, and consider implications for the cost effectiveness of the intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

The first intervention, storage support, provided community storage rehabilitation, extra palm oil containers and marketing support to target communities. The second intervention, inventory credit, disbursed loans, while allowing farmers to use the oil stored in the community storage as collateral for the loans. The project aimed to allow farmers to better take advantage of variations in the sale prices of oil between the harvest and the off-seasons. The implementation of the interventions was coordinated by the Sierra Leone National Program Coordinating Unit (NPCU) at the Ministry of Agriculture and three Rural and Agricultural Banks (RABs). The report covers the first year of the intervention. The evaluation design was based on a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). A sample of 120 palm oil-producing villages located in the catchment areas of the three RABs was split into three groups. The first received the storage support intervention; the second received the inventory credit scheme; and the third was monitored as a control group. The evaluation draws from two main survey instruments (baseline and endline), logs of palm oil production and storage, and administrative data from the program. Analysis of baseline data shows that in the year previous to the intervention: (i) palm oil prices showed substantial increases from the harvest season to the offseason; (ii) farmers sell predominantly within a few months of harvesting and store only small amounts across seasons. The take-up rate was 29.9% for the storage support and 24.9% for the inventory credit. The programs did not have a significant impact on overall storage behavior or on the patterns of oil sales across seasons. The storage within the scheme primarily substituted for other forms of storage. Therefore, in the first year, the two schemes provided limited benefits for the participating communities. A simple profitability analysis reveals that, under the observed price dynamics, farmers could substantially increase revenues and profits from palm oil by raising their levels of storage. However, the evaluation documents low take-up of the programs. The report combines survey data and qualitative analysis to shed light on some potential reasons for low take-up. These include uncertainty over price realizations; low acquaintanceship and potentially low trust toward formal credit institutions; and high switching costs from existing trading relationships. The report concludes by highlighting lessons for implementing similar schemes in other countries or focusing on other crops.</td>\n",

Decentralized models assume that information flows from researchers to extension workers, and from extension agents to contact farmers (CFs). CFs should then train other farmers in their communities. Such a modality may fail to address informational inefficiencies and accountability issues. We run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. We track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs. However, higher levels of CF adoption have limited impact on the behavior of other farmers.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Weather-based insurance products insure farmers against production risks on the basis of a weather index that is highly correlated to local yields. Indemnifications are triggered by prespecified patterns of the index, as opposed to actual yields. This eliminates the requirement of on-field assessments for indemnification, thereby lowering administrative costs and time. Therefore, index-based insurance products have been regarded as having enormous potential to reach small farmers in developing countries. Surprisingly, the demand and takeup rates are low for weather index insurance (WII) products. One of the reasons hypothesised for the low demand and take-up of index-based insurance products is their inherent complexity, which makes it difficult for farmers to perceive the direct benefits. Hence, to encourage stronger participation, the project introduced an innovative WII product that was simple, transparent, flexible and affordable for smallholder farmers. In fact, the insurance product was a menu of very simple insurance options, each with a flat payment, but different triggers and for different coverage periods. This product was tested in three districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, during two consecutive summer agricultural seasons (known as kharif in India) in 2011 and 2012 among the farmers who were cultivating rain fed soya bean crop. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of the product (simplified WII) on the production and consumption behaviours of smallholder farmers. In addition to this, the research also investigated the responsiveness of insurance demand to a set of randomly allocated interventions among farmers who were offered insurance products. These are: 1) Exogenous variation of the distance to the weather station by installing three new weather stations, which were randomly positioned. 2) Random assignment of price discounts for the insurance offered. 3) Provision of training to all farmers being offered the insurance product, but random variation of the intensity of training across villages. A comparison of differences in outcome variables among the baseline and a follow-up survey between control and treatment villages (through a difference in differences estimation) provided us with a test of the impact of offering WII to smallholder farmers. Empirically, we find evidence for the impact of our specific WII product, although results are not strong, arguably due to a lack of power that arose because of low take-up of the product. On the other hand, comparing take-up rates between different (randomly allocated) treatment arms allowed us to evaluate the responsiveness of insurance demand to our interventions, namely price discounts, weather station investments (a proxy to basis risk) and intensive training on insurance literacy. Overall, the demand for our simplified WII products was quite low, at 6.9 per cent and 4.03 per cent of the sample during kharif 2011 and 2012, respectively. We find that the demand falls as price and distance to the weather station increase. On the other hand, the demand for WII increases as product comprehension increases. Interestingly, the intensive insurance literacy training sessions conducted in the first year seem to be of a more transient nature, with no significant impact on understanding or demand during the second year. In terms of the dynamic effects of the programme, while purchasing insurance does not have a substantial impact on demand on its own in the subsequent year/season, purchasing insurance and receiving a payout is strongly positively correlated with the decision to purchase insurance in the subsequent season. However, observing other households in the village receiving a payout seems to have no impact on demand. This could also be explained by the low levels of trust in the product or the insurance company. This is an interesting avenue for future research. The study seems to support the hypothesis that the purchase of WII could have influenced the farmers to use hybrid seeds or high-yielding varieties to cultivate increased areas, to cultivate new crops, to adopt improved cultivation practices and to get additional loans. However, these results are not statistically strong. The insights gained from the study enable us to propose the following policy recommendations: 1) Thin networks of weather stations restrict the demand and scale-up of WII. 2) Provision of weather data by the weather service providers to the insurers has to happen without any time lag to enable quick indemnification. 3) Distribution and marketing channels are key to enhance take-up and scale-up of WII programmes. 4) An improved design of the WII product is key to minimise basis risk. 5) Affordability of WII insurance premiums is essential for a sustained take-up from smallholder farmers. 6) One-time WII literacy programmes have little, if any, long-lasting impact on insurance understanding and demand. This suggests that WII literacy programmes should be designed as part of a more permanent process over time so they can contribute to developing more sustainable micro-insurance markets (although more rigorous evidence of this recommendation will require longer-term research projects than this one).</td>\n",

              "      <td>We examine the sustainability of the impact of a biofortification program that introduced provitamin A-rich orange sweet potatoes (OSP) to farming households in Uganda. The crop was introduced in a randomized controlled experiment to test the impact and costeffectiveness of introducing OSP on crop adoption and dietary intakes of vitamin A. A previous impact evaluation of the two-year project using baseline and endline data found large impacts on both OSP adoption and vitamin A consumption in project households. Here, we study sustainability of the intervention by looking at the profile of OSP adoption during the project and over four seasons after the project's end. After achieving an adoption rate of 92 percent in the first season, a trajectory of declining adoption continued, and may have accelerated, after the project ended. Mean adoption rates fell to 37 percent four seasons after the project ended. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the adoption patterns across districts and between primary beneficiaries and neighboring farming households. This is consistent with a pattern of experimentation among initial adopters followed by a period of learning about profitability and consumption preference for the crop. Non-beneficiaries display a similar pattern of learning. We explore the mechanisms that predict decline and persistence in adoption behavior among various types of farmers, and consider implications for the cost effectiveness of the intervention.</td>\n",

Its record has been judged positively during the recession period of the 1990s and negatively during the more recent growth phase. This paper reconsiders the program using a regression-adjusted matching estimator rst suggested by Heckman et al. (1997, 1998) and exploiting discontinuities in program design and targeting failures. We nd the program to have a weak targeting capacity and a negative and signi cant impact on welfare. We also nd that recent changes introduced to the program have not improved its performance. An analysis of the distributional impact of treatment based on stochastic dominance theory suggests that our results are robust.\",\n          \"In countries experiencing the dual burden of HIV disease and health care worker shortages, information and communication technology tools offer the potential to help support HIV treatment adherence and secondary HIV transmission risk reduction for people living with HIV/AIDS. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (September 1, 2011-July 12, 2012) with follow-up through April 2013. Participants were recruited from two clinics affiliated with the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program in western Kenya. A total of 236 participants were enrolled, randomly assigned to intervention (n = 118) or risk-assessment only control (n = 118) and followed up for 9 months. Both arms had > 0.5 log10 reduction in viral load over time (p = .0007), a clinically relevant finding.
